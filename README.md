t2c  ![Travis CI Status](https://api.travis-ci.org/johanjordaan/t2c.svg?branch=master "Travis CI Status")
=========

This is a very simple templating engine. It is diffrent from other templating engines since it prodices code which will produce the output. It is further code centric and the text to be emitted is escaped, not the code. I belive this produces better looking 
template output.

`npm install t2c`

or 

`bower install t2c`
